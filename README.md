# CONNECTIONTEST

This is a simple Python script that allows you to test a website's connectivity. It uses the popular requests library to make a GET request to a specified URL and returns whether the connection was successful or not.

## Getting Started

To use this script, simply download the `connectiontest.py` file and run it in your Python environment. When prompted, enter the URL you wish to test the connection for. The script will attempt to connect to the URL and return a message indicating whether the connection was successful or not.

## Dependencies

This script requires the requests library to be installed in your Python environment. If you do not already have requests installed, you can install it using pip:

`
pip install requests
`

## Usage

`
python connectiontest.py
`
